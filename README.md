# Twitter Sentiment Analysis - NLP Project

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Logistic Regression model. The aim is to classify tweets as **positive** or **negative** based on their content.

## ‚ùì Why Sentiment Analysis Matters

Every day, millions of people express opinions on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook. Sentiment analysis allows us to automatically process and classify these opinions as **positive, negative, or neutral** using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This helps businesses, researchers, and organizations gain insights from unstructured text at scale‚Äîsomething that's impossible to do manually.

## üîç Project Significance

This project demonstrates how to use basic NLP techniques‚Äîlike tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization‚Äîcombined with a **Logistic Regression** model to perform binary sentiment classification on tweets.

Despite its simplicity, Logistic Regression can be quite effective for linearly separable data, making it a great baseline model for sentiment classification tasks.
